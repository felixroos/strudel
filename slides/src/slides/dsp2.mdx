\*dsp = dough signal processing

- trigger = gets called for each event
- dsp function gets called for each sample at time t (in seconds), think bytebeat / floatbeat

- [doughbeat](https://github.com/felixroos/doughbeat) -> single-html-file floatbeat editor with audioworklet
- [doughbat](https://github.com/felixroos/doughbat) -> doughbeat but with assemblyscript compiled on-the-fly to wasm
